In the past, when instructors taught mathematical concepts of geometry shapes, they usually used traditional textbooks and aids to conduct teaching activities, which resulted in students not being able to understand the principles completely. Nowadays, it has become a trend to integrate emerging technologies into mathematics courses and to use digital instructional aids. Emerging technologies can effectively enhance students' sensory experience while strengthening their impressions and understandings of subject concepts. In this paper, we apply virtual reality immersive technologies to develop a ""virtual reality immersive learning mathematics geometry system,"" which is used to teach mathematical geometry concepts. Teachers use the system to develop three basic mathematical geometry learning materials: ""Triangular pyramid volume = 1/3 prism volume,"" ""Cone volume calculation,"" and ""Triangle center of gravity derivation."" In the experimental activity, the teacher uses virtual reality teaching aids to guide students to learn mathematical geometry concepts in a fun way so that they can achieve the effectiveness of immersive learning. This study explores the impact of using the virtual reality immersive learning mathematics geometry system on students' technology acceptance, learning motivations, and learning performance. The experimental result showed that using the virtual reality immersive learning mathematics geometry system can improve the learning motivation and learning performance of students. The findings indicated that the experimental group had better learning outcomes after completing the learning tasks of three geometric units. The experimental group used the virtual reality immersive learning mathematics geometry system which can lead to better learning outcomes. According to the ARCS questionnaire, students in the experimental group were confident to understand new subjects. At the same time, the mode of completing the game can effectively give students a sense of accomplishment. The use of emerging technologies in the classroom can be an attractive learning mode for students.",Journal

Methods/Statistical analysis: The subjects of this study were 121 nursing students from a university in area D. After experiential learning with virtual reality from 6-8 June 2019, data was collected through questionnaires. For virtual reality learning, VIVE's hTC VIVE ECO CE model was used. The collected data was analyzed using the IBM SPSS 26.0 program. Multiple Regression Analysis was used to analyze the factors influencing the subject's virtual reality learning effects. Findings: The learning effects of the virtual reality medium had a statistically significant positive correlation with the virtual reality technology recognition, sensory immersion, realism, learning satisfaction, learning necessity, and continuous use intention (p < 0.001) scores. In personality traits, only Openness, Extraversion (p < 0.01), and Conscientiousness (p < 0.05) had a statistically significant positive correlation. As a result of regression analysis, the explanatory power of the learning effect of the virtual reality medium was 63.9% (F = 53.61, p < 0.001), with learning satisfaction, sensory immersion, continuous use intention, and Extraversion being significant influencing factors (p < 0.05). Improvements/Applications: This study is meaningful in the sense that it provided strategic implications for the teaching and learning method of virtual reality technology-based learning by considering the insights necessary to develop a learning program using virtual reality technology, according to the characteristics of virtual reality technology, and the learner's cognitive and psychological variables.",Journal

Moreover, efforts in blended learning have presented several advantages of incorporating educational technology into the learning space. The advances in educational technology have in turn helped to widen the choice of different pedagogies for improving learner engagement and levels of understanding. However, there is limited research in anatomy education that has considered the use and adoption of immersive technologies for the musculoskeletal system, despite its immense advantage. This research presents a practical immersive anatomy education system (coined Anat_Hub) developed using the agile scrum and participatory design method at a selected tertiary institution in Cape Town, South Africa, which promotes learner engagement through an asynchronous technological means using augmented reality (AR). The aim of the study was to develop an immersive AR mobile application that will assist learners and educators in studying and teaching the names, attachments, and actions of muscles of the human musculoskeletal system (upper and lower limbs). The Anat_Hub application offers a wide range of useful features for promoting active and self-regulated learning, such as 3D and AR modes, glossary, and quiz features. The application was tested with potential users, and on a variety of mobile device specifications. Very few volunteers have used AR prior to this study (13.2%). On a scale of 1 to 5, the majority of volunteers scored the application a 4 or 5.

However, there is limited research in anatomy education that has considered the use and adoption of immersive technologies for the musculoskeletal system, despite its immense advantage. This research presents a practical immersive anatomy education system (coined Anat_Hub) developed using the agile scrum and participatory design method at a selected tertiary institution in Cape Town, South Africa, which promotes learner engagement through an asynchronous technological means using augmented reality (AR). The aim of the study was to develop an immersive AR mobile application that will assist learners and educators in studying and teaching the names, attachments, and actions of muscles of the human musculoskeletal system (upper and lower limbs). The Anat_Hub application offers a wide range of useful features for promoting active and self-regulated learning, such as 3D and AR modes, glossary, and quiz features. The application was tested with potential users, and on a variety of mobile device specifications. Very few volunteers have used AR prior to this study (13.2%).

Participants (n = 110) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) no cues, (2) textual cues in the initial field of view (FOV), (3) textual cues outside the initial FOV, and (4) textual cues outside the initial FOV + visual cues. The results showed that the cues (annotations or annotations + arrows) helped learners achieve better learning outcomes and spend more time focusing on the areas with cues. In addition, the study found a serious imbalance in the distribution of learners' attention in each region of the video.

This study examined the effects of textual and visual cues on learning and attention in immersive 360-degree video by using eye-tracking equipment integrated in a virtual reality head-mounted display. Participants (n = 110) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) no cues, (2) textual cues in the initial field of view (FOV), (3) textual cues outside the initial FOV, and (4) textual cues outside the initial FOV + visual cues. The results showed that the cues (annotations or annotations + arrows) helped learners achieve better learning outcomes and spend more time focusing on the areas with cues. In addition, the study found a serious imbalance in the distribution of learners' attention in each region of the video. The attention directed to textual cues in the initial FOV is much higher than the attention directed to textual cues outside the initial FOV. Adding visual cues can effectively direct attention to textual cues outside the initial FOV and alleviate the imbalance of attention distribution.

The new characteristics of rapidly iterative technology and evolving theory of the digital age brought new challenges, especially for art and design teaching. At the same time, with the continuous progress of computer hardware level, all kinds of simulation technology constantly emerge, which also brought new opportunities for art design work. Art design teaching, as a systematic project, should use advanced teaching techniques with scientific theories. In the process of teaching design, how are all parts connected with each other, and what are the problems and needs of students and teachers? Through the analysis and research of these, we are aimed at finding ways and methods to solve these problems and needs, and to achieve the optimal teaching effect. The mode, technology, and methods of traditional art design teaching are getting more and more difficult to meet the needs of the society for comprehensive design art talents. Based on virtual reality technology and aimed at the art design teaching system, this paper studies the application of the immersive virtual reality technology in the design teaching practice. On the basis of the traditional design teaching mode, the integrated three-dimensional design teaching mode is put forward and verified. It can inspire students' creative inspiration in design teaching and guide them to immerse in learning and three-dimensional practice, constantly opening up creative thinking.",Journal

The third part is the practical exercise based on the first two parts; that is, from the learning effect and attitude of the student as the main body, the theoretical basis of the two parts on visual sensors and immersive virtual reality physical education teaching is transformed into real practice teaching. In the experiment part, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and support of immersive virtual teaching, on the one hand, we started with the teaching of teachers, and on the other hand, we carried out investigations from the aspects of students' learning. The desktop virtual environment teaching method is compared with the existing classroom teaching methods. The image processing and image analysis of the virtual reality technology are combined with the image gray level of the three-dimensional image to analyze the multitask algorithm of the vision sensor. The feasibility of immersive virtual teaching was verified. Research data shows that the 10 students participating in the experiment gave a score of 7.9 for the target attitude of immersive virtual reality physical education. Students' interest in learning will increase, and efficiency will also be greatly improved.

The first part is the discussion of immersive teaching, which includes the research of virtual immersive classroom teaching. The second part is a separate analysis of virtual reality technology. The third part is the practical exercise based on the first two parts; that is, from the learning effect and attitude of the student as the main body, the theoretical basis of the two parts on visual sensors and immersive virtual reality physical education teaching is transformed into real practice teaching. In the experiment part, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and support of immersive virtual teaching, on the one hand, we started with the teaching of teachers, and on the other hand, we carried out investigations from the aspects of students' learning. The desktop virtual environment teaching method is compared with the existing classroom teaching methods. The image processing and image analysis of the virtual reality technology are combined with the image gray level of the three-dimensional image to analyze the multitask algorithm of the vision sensor. The feasibility of immersive virtual teaching was verified. Research data shows that the 10 students participating in the experiment gave a score of 7.9 for the target attitude of immersive virtual reality physical education. Students' interest in learning will increase, and efficiency will also be greatly improved. VR can not only provide students with a new learning experience but also be used to strengthen teachers' teaching skills. Because VR can simulate a real teaching environment, teachers can use this set of tools to try new course materials and improve classroom management capabilities.",Journal

This article is aimed at demonstrating the important role of a virtual reality immersive physical education model in current physical education and analyzing the immersive virtual reality physical education model. Relying on the mature VR virtual reality technology to establish a virtual simulation experiment platform, the application value in the education field is also reflected in the saving of experimental teaching costs.

Ann Sin Nga Lau,The Chinese University of Hong Kong,Hong Kong,18,,A Simulation Design of Immersive Virtual Reality for Animal Handling Training to Biomedical Sciences Undergraduates,2021,8.0,"immersive virtual reality, 4R principles, simulation, animal handling, biomedical research, undergraduate, teaching and learning",2.0,FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION,"Background: One area of biomedical research concerns is applying new treatments to cure human diseases, moving bench-side research to the bedside practice. While using animal models is crucial in the research process, researchers should strictly adhere to the moral 4R framework to protect animal welfare-replacement, reduction, refinement, and responsibility. Virtual reality (VR) applies computer technology to create a simulated environment, allowing players to immerse and interact with animated 3D contexts. We developed a virtual animal-holding simulator (ViSi) using immersive virtual reality technology for students studying in the undergraduate biomedical sciences programme. The specific objectives of the paper are to 1) describe the development of the VR courseware for animal training and 2) describe the learning experience among students. Method and Result: An evaluation of the courseware was conducted among Year one and two biomedical sciences students. Students who participated in ViSi responded positively about their involvement in the virtual environment experience and their concentration on the assigned task. Discussion: ViSi is a reliable simulation technology that can train animal handling skills, which replaces real animals, while learners' multi-cognition could still be enhanced with simulation training. Thus, the impact of immersive VR technology integrated into skills training is promising, although few technical problems are to be resolved.",Journal

(b) Would knowledge be retained longer by using AR? (c) Is there any relationship between academic achievement, acceptance and motivation regarding the use of this technology? Embracing the socio-constructivist theory of learning and collaborative and immersive learning as a framework, this study was carried out using a quantitative approach and a pre-experimental design.

Therefore, this study was designed to answer the following questions: (1) Is IVR a useful tool to learn and practice problem-solving skills? More specifically, do children using IVR solve a game better than those using a tablet application or a board game? (2) Does IVR provide a more engaging experience for children to practice problem-solving skills than on a tablet or a board game?

,,,27,,Infusing Augmented Reality in Bilingual and ESL Education: Perceptions from Pre-service teachers,2021,,,,INNOEDUCA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION,"In recent years there has been an increased interest by Teacher Education programs to train its pre-service teachers with immersive technologies. This had led to a greater boom and exploration of teaching possibilities of these technologies, especially with augmented reality and its integration to the bilingual and ESL classroom. The following article presents a recent study that was conducted at Texas Woman's University with n=27 bilingual and ESL pre-service teachers. It served as a pilot and sought to determine pre-service teachers' perceptions on the strengths and limitations in the use of augmented reality for the bilingual and ESL classroom. It also sought to provide an understanding of potential mobile applications, educational implications and activities for the classroom. The study used a qualitative method following an exploratory design and integrated a content analysis. The findings indicated that the participants view AR as a strength to keep students engaged and motivated. On the other hand, access to AR technology was perceived as a limitation. The integration of AR applications such as Quiver and HP Reveal along with the integration of Culturally Relevant Teaching (Gay, 2013) supported the creation of activities (e.g., AR walls and class demonstrations) that were perceived by pre-service teacher candidates as possibilities to support learning in the bilingual and ESL classroom. The study also pointed out the need for more research on the topic.",Journal

The study focused on improvement of students' EFL abilities, intercultural communicative competence (ICC), and knowledge sharing (KS). A group of second-year students from China were partnered with a group of university students from Indonesia. 360-degree video technology was used to create an authentic and immersive intercultural learning environment in which students created content in English related to their culture and traditions, shared content with partners from the other culture, and reflected on their intercultural learning. We investigated whether learning activities supported by 360-degree video technology have positive impact on EFL learning, ICC development, and KS. The data was collected through questionnaires, tests, observations, and interviews. Three main findings were obtained in the study. The results demonstrated that 360-degree video technology-supported intercultural learning activities improved students' EFL abilities, ICC, and KS. In addition, it was found that dimensions of KS and ICC have significant relationship with each other. Finally, the students had a positive attitude toward the learning activities supported by 360-degree video technology, were satisfied with the technology, and had intentions to use it in the future for learning. On this basis, we made several suggestions for educators and researchers.",Journal

A sample of 79 undergraduate biology students (40 females, 37 males, 2 non-binary) learned about next-generation sequencing using an IVR simulation that lasted approximately 45 min. Students were randomly assigned to one of two instructional conditions: self-explanation (n = 41) or control (n = 38). The self-explanation group engaged in a 10 min written self-explanation task after the IVR biology lesson, while the control group rested. The results revealed that the IVR simulation led to a significant increase in knowledge from the pre- to post-test (ss(Posterior) = 3.29). There were no differences between the self-explanation and control groups on knowledge gain, procedural, or conceptual transfer. Finally, the results indicate that the self-explanation group reported significantly higher intrinsic cognitive load (ss(Posterior) = .35), and extraneous cognitive load (ss(Posterior) = .37), and significantly lower germane load (ss(Posterior) = - .38) than the control group.

Díaz Villanueva,University of Cádiz,Spain,35,,Creation of Immersive Resources Based on Virtual Reality for Dissemination and Teaching in Chemical Engineering,2022,6.0,chemical engineering; immersion; virtual reality; 360° videos; laboratory practices,0.0,EDUCATION SCIENCES,"Chemical Engineering is a complex discipline that is mainly applied to the industrial context, which makes it difficult to approach real equipment and systems in the classroom to students. Nevertheless, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are particularly useful to encourage active and autonomous learning, normally associated with deeper levels of engagement and understanding of the subjects taught. In this way, several studies have demonstrated that immersion has the potential to increase learning experiences and improve creativity and engagement, Virtual Reality (VR) being a remarkable example. In this context, we created and shared with students two immersive resources based on VR: (a) a laboratory 360 degrees video tour, which was used to disseminate the Chemical Engineering Degree in an Open Door Days organized for high school students; and (b) an experiential learning tool integrated with Moodle, which was available previously to face-to-face practical lessons of the subject Separation Operations. In both cases, the feedback from the participant students was positive. High school students increased their interest in Chemical Engineering Degree after viewing the 360 degrees video, meanwhile undergraduate students found the immersive tool useful in the subsequent performance of real practical activities. From the perspective of professors, creation of these resources required purchase of equipment, time and effort, but they were highly valued as a tool for disseminating and supporting teaching, being an initial starting point for the creation of more enhanced VR-based materials.",Journal

We assessed spatial knowledge acquisition in male and female participants using a technology not previously examined empirically: the digital fulldome. Our primary aim was to examine whether performance on a test of survey knowledge was better in a fulldome (N = 28, 12 males) relative to a large, flat screen display (N = 27, 13 males). Regression analysis showed that, compared to a flat screen display, males showed higher levels of performance on a test of survey knowledge after learning in the fulldome, but no benefit occurred for females. Furthermore, performance correlated with spatial visualization ability in male participants, but not in female participants. Thus, the digital fulldome is a potentially useful learning aid, capable of accommodating multiple users, but individual differences and use of strategy need to be considered.",Journal

This study used the virtual reality (VR) technology to develop a virtual ecological environment for learning about the Taipei tree frog, supported by situated learning and game-based learning design to enhance students' learning interest and motivation. Users can wear the head-mounted display (HMD) to explore the virtual environment for learning the Taipei tree frog's ecological behavior, such as foraging and mating as well as its habitats and predators. A teaching experiment was conducted to investigate students' learning effectiveness and the senses of presence and anxiety after using the virtual ecological environment. The experimental group (wearing the HMD) contained 40 students, the control group (using the desktop VR) contained 40 students, and both groups were used as samples to learn about the Taipei tree frog. The results indicated that using HMD VR and desktop VR could both enhance learning achievements, but the learning effectiveness of the former was significantly higher than that of the latter. The levels of anxiety for both groups were about the same, but the level of presence for the experimental group was higher than that of the control group because the HMD VR provided a more immersive experience than the desktop VR.

It is important to raise the probability that students can successfully apply acquired knowledge into practice. This article deals with virtual reality (VR) as an alternative method to provide students with a more immersive approach to semester assignments and their completion. In addition to information on paper, they are provided with an immersive virtual environment that interactively visualizes problems. To test this approach, a case study took place at the Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Zilina. Students were given a standard assignment for workplace analysis and optimization. However, in addition to papers containing all the necessary information about the workplace and its processes (a drilling workplace), the students could also put on a VR headset and walk through a virtual copy of the assigned workplace. Instead of relying on a 2D layout and a few photos, the students observed every detail of the workplace from any angle. Moreover, the immersive virtual workplace was interactive, and the students could interact with machine tools and replicate the real manufacturing process. With this new addition, the students completed the assignment and then filled out a short questionnaire questioning their satisfaction with the chosen approach. With positive feedback, the implementation of VR into the teaching process could further motivate students and make the transfer of knowledge into their future jobs easier.",Journal

In this study, an immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual radiography simulation tool was piloted in an undergraduate Radiography curriculum and user feedback retrieved.Methods: The 3D virtual simulation tool by Virtual Medical Coaching Ltd was introduced to first year radiography students (n = 105). This technology guided students through a comprehensive process of learning anatomy, radiographic positioning and pathology. Students then X-rayed a virtual patient in the VR suite using HTC Vive Pro (TM) headsets and hand controllers. Instant feedback was provided. An online survey was later disseminated to students to gather user feedback. Thematic and descriptive statistical analyses were applied.Results: A response rate of 79% (n = 83) was achieved. Most respondents (58%) reported enjoying VR simulation, whilst some felt indifferent towards it (27%). Ninety-four percent would recommend this tool to other students. The mean length of time it took for students to feel comfortable using the technology was 60 min (10-240 min). Most respondents (58%) desired more VR access. Students attributed enhanced confidence in the areas of beam collimation (75%), anatomical marker placement (63%), centring of the X-ray tube (64%) and exposure parameter selection (56%) to their VR practice.

In this work, we proposed navigation tasks in immersive virtual reality (IVR) to 15 children with CP and 13 typically developing (TD) peers in order to assess the individual navigation strategies and their modifiability in a situation resembling real life.Methods: We developed and adapted to IVR an application based on a 5-way maze in a playground that was to be navigated to find a reward. The learning process, navigation strategies, and adaptation to changes were compared between participants with CP and their TD peers and correlated with visual-spatial abilities and cognitive competences.Results: Most participants with CP needed more attempts than TD participants to become proficient in navigation. Furthermore, the learning phase was correlated to visual-spatial memory but not with cognitive competences. Interestingly, navigation skills were comparable between groups after stabilization. While TD participants mainly relied on allocentric strategies based on environmental cues, egocentric (self-centered) strategies based on body motion prevailed in participants with CP. Furthermore, participants with CP had more difficulties in modifying their navigation strategies, caused by difficulties in executive processes beyond the visual-perceptual impairment, with an inefficient shift between implicit and explicit competences.Conclusions: The navigation abilities in participants with CP seem to be different from their TD peers in terms of learning and adaptation to new conditions; this could deeply affect their everyday life and ultimately participation and inclusion.

Providing a shared control/view may improve the task performance and enhance the user experience during VR collaboration.[Objectives] Therefore, this research explores the effect of collaborative modes and user position arrangements on task performance, user engagement, and collaboration behaviors and patterns in a VR learning environment that supports immersive collaborative tasks.[Method] The study involved two collaborative modes (shared and non-shared view and control) and three position arrangements (side-by-side, corner-to-corner, and back-to-back). A user study was conducted with 30 participants divided into three groups (Single, Shared, and Non-Shared) using a VR application that allowed users to explore the structural and transformational properties of 3D geometric shapes.[Results] The results showed that the shared mode would lead to higher task performance than single users for learning analytics tasks in VR. Besides, the side-by-side position got a higher score and more favor for enhancing the collaborative experience.[Conclusion] The shared view would be more suitable for improving task performance in collaborative VR. In addition, the side-by-side position may provide a higher user experience when collaborating in learning VR.

Providing a shared control/view may improve the task performance and enhance the user experience during VR collaboration.[Objectives] Therefore, this research explores the effect of collaborative modes and user position arrangements on task performance, user engagement, and collaboration behaviors and patterns in a VR learning environment that supports immersive collaborative tasks.[Method] The study involved two collaborative modes (shared and non-shared view and control) and three position arrangements (side-by-side, corner-to-corner, and back-to-back). A user study was conducted with 30 participants divided into three groups (Single, Shared, and Non-Shared) using a VR application that allowed users to explore the structural and transformational properties of 3D geometric shapes.[Results] The results showed that the shared mode would lead to higher task performance than single users for learning analytics tasks in VR.

We hypothesized that after the VR tutorial, junior fellows and residents will have comparable recall of the proper steps as experienced trainees.MethodsThis project was initiated in the pediatric intensive care unit from July 1, 2019, to July 30, 2019. Volunteer residents and pediatric critical care medicine fellows participated. The VR group completed a 19-minute immersive tutorial and then demonstrated learned skills with a traditional manikin. Non-VR group fellows listed steps to prepare for airway intubation from memory with scoring on a 24-point timed checklist.ResultsSeventeen subjects participated; two residents were excluded. The VR group had seven trainees (47%) and scored similarly to the other group based on checklist items (50.5% vs 50.8%, P=1).ConclusionVR technologies can be used for education in preparation for pediatric airway intubation. There was no difference in the performance accuracy between the two groups. Larger studies are essential to study benefits of VR in preparation and performance of airway intubation.",Journal

Virtual and Augmented Reality have a clear potential in education and can solve this problem. Serious games that use immersive technologies allow students to visit and interact with environments dated in different ages. Taking this in mind, this article presents a playful virtual reality experience set in Ancient Rome that allows the user to learn concepts from that age. The virtual experience reproduces as accurately as possible the different buildings and civil constructions of the time, making it possible for the player to create Roman cities in a simple way. Once built, the user can visit them, accessing the buildings and being able to interact with the objects and characters that appear. Moreover, in order to learn more information about every building, users can visualize them using Augmented Reality using marker-based techniques. Different information has been included related to every building, such as their main uses, characteristics, or even some images that represent them. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed experience, several experiments have been carried out, taking as sample Secondary School students. Initially, the game's quality and playability has been evaluated and, subsequently, the motivation of the virtual learning experience in history. The results obtained support on the one hand its gameplay and attractiveness, and on the other, the student's increased interest in studying history, as well as the greater fixation of different concepts treated in a playful experience.",Journal

Taking this in mind, this article presents a playful virtual reality experience set in Ancient Rome that allows the user to learn concepts from that age. The virtual experience reproduces as accurately as possible the different buildings and civil constructions of the time, making it possible for the player to create Roman cities in a simple way. Once built, the user can visit them, accessing the buildings and being able to interact with the objects and characters that appear. Moreover, in order to learn more information about every building, users can visualize them using Augmented Reality using marker-based techniques. Different information has been included related to every building, such as their main uses, characteristics, or even some images that represent them. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed experience, several experiments have been carried out, taking as sample Secondary School students. Initially, the game's quality and playability has been evaluated and, subsequently, the motivation of the virtual learning experience in history. The results obtained support on the one hand its gameplay and attractiveness, and on the other, the student's increased interest in studying history, as well as the greater fixation of different concepts treated in a playful experience.",Journal

Ninety-three participants distributed in four conditions took part in the experiment. The four conditions manipulated the collective and individual dimensions of the learning environment as well as the high and low immersion of the learning material. The two conditions that offered a high immersion setting used two types of the novel immersive dome: a large one for collective immersion and a small one for individual use. All participants were presented with the same stimuli, an 8-min-long video of a virtual neighbourhood visit in Paris in the 18th century. The participants' reactions were measured during and after the task. The learning outcome, as well as the cognitive, emotional and behavioural engagement, were measured.

However, these quantities are not covered by human visual perception, and since heat sensation is purely qualitative and easy to deceive, an intuitive understanding often is lacking. Today immersive technologies like head-mounted displays of the newest generation, especially HoloLens, allow for high-quality augmented reality learning experiences, which can overcome this gap in human perception by presenting different representations of otherwise invisible quantities directly in the field of view of the user on the experimental apparatus, which simultaneously avoids a split-attention effect. In a mixed reality (MR) scenario as presented in this paper-which we call a holo.lab-human perception can be extended to the thermal regime by presenting false-color representations of the temperature of objects as a virtual augmentation directly on the real object itself in real-time. Direct feedback to experimental actions of the users in the form of different representations allows for immediate comparison to theoretical principles and predictions and therefore is supposed to intensify the theory-experiment interactions and to increase students' conceptual understanding. We tested this technology for an experiment on thermal conduction of metals in the framework of undergraduate laboratories. A pilot study with treatment and control groups (N = 59) showed a small positive effect of MR on students' performance measured with a standardized concept test for thermodynamics, pointing to an improvement of the understanding of the underlying physical concepts. These findings indicate that complex experiments could benefit even more from augmentation. This motivates us to enrich further experiments with MR.",Journal

The use of augmented reality (AR) under visuospatial bootstrapping (VSB), a novel approach developed from work on the cognitive psychology of working memory, was contrasted with an established application, Quizlet that has been extensively used in foreign-language teaching. The AR-VSB technique offered superior vocabulary learning compared with the Quizlet method in delayed post-tests, although statistical data indicate a somewhat higher forgetting rate after a week in the AR-VSB method. Even so, the experimental technique still offers superior retention compared with the method used in the control group and could be used as an effective initial input method for acquiring vocabulary items in second-language learning. The main novel conclusionin this research has been that the integration of immersive AR experiences into familiar physical space has been seen to improve vocabulary recall test performance among a sample of twenty-first-century university students attempting to learn a second language. The evidence gathered from the experiment can have future practical applications and might contribute to immersive educational technology and innovative material development in second-language instruction.",Journal

Xiuhua Ye,Jiaying University,China,72,,A realist evaluation of student use of a virtual reality smartphone application in undergraduate legal education,2020,2.0,"CMO framework, legal education, theory-driven/realist evaluation, virtual reality",48.0,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,"This paper provides a realist evaluation of the Open Justice virtual reality (VR) smartphone app, designed to develop presentation skills for students on an undergraduate legal education module. This work addresses two research questions: what proportion of students engaged with the Open Justice app, and what worked for whom in what circumstances and why? Questionnaire and interviews were conducted and analysed using a realist evaluation approach. This approach is particularly pertinent to the evaluation of how emerging educational technologies are used, as it can point to the potential affordances of a technological intervention, in addition to assessing its current use. In keeping with the realist evaluation approach, data analysis was completed using the context-mechanism-outcome framework. The findings suggest that more than half of students did not engage with the app during their studies, but this was not surprising as it was a pilot project into using VR with our students and such innovations can be difficult to manage in distance education contexts. Those who did engage with it recognised the potential of immersive VR to contribute to legal skills development, but they found the application of the technology, in this context, to be of limited use. By utilising a realist evaluation framework, this study contributes to the emerging field of programme theory-based evaluations of educational technology, which might form the basis of further research. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Smartphone-based virtual reality technology has developed exponentially and is now widely and cheaply available. Smartphone-based virtual reality technology has the potential to develop professional skills, and thereby provide a useful addition to experiential learning pedagogies. This is of particular relevance to the development of professional legal skills in the context of clinical legal education. Realist evaluation methodology is increasingly common in health literature to evaluate the impact of education programmes. What this paper adds This is the first empirical study of the use of VR technology to develop professional skills in a distance learning setting. This is the first paper to use realist methodology to evaluate virtual reality technology in legal education. It provides a granular analysis of particular contexts and user responses that can facilitate or inhibit learner engagement with VR technology. Implications for practice and/or policy It provides an analysis of VR used to support teaching and learning, where the students are distance learners-this highlights issues and challenges to be overcome. It provides an evidence base to inform the development of, and further research into, smartphone-based virtual reality for legal education settings. It provides a detailed example of how realist methodology can be utilised to evaluate educational technology in real-world settings.",Journal
Xiaotao Wang,Shangqiu Normal University,China,73,,Optimization of Multimodal Japanese Teaching Model Using Virtual Reality,2022,1.0,,,MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"The potential of virtual reality technology to aid education is well acknowledged. It has already been implemented in at least 20 public schools and institutions, with many more participating in assessment and research initiatives. The proposed methodology is to use virtual reality technology in Japanese teaching in order to create an immersive virtual teaching environment for the learners. They can see and hear Japanese teaching through visual, auditory, tactile, and other senses. They can also interact through virtual reality. The objects simulated by this technology interact with each other, thus creating a feeling of living in a super world. The products of virtual reality technology can be used as a new tool for learning the Japanese language. On the one hand, the advantages of virtual reality technology are assisting Japanese teaching and training due to its immersive, interactive, and systematic characteristics. On the other hand, we can use multimodal data fusion to make the data sources more diversified and optimize the Japanese teaching model through virtual reality technology. In addition, more effective and interesting teaching methods provide references for others. The experimental results show that our multimodal fusion BP (backpropagation) neural network algorithm provides a better result than the single decision tree algorithm and support vector machine algorithm.",Journal

Some results from this research stage are: criteria for designing a teaching-learning sequence (e.g., how to utilize place as an opportunity for learning science with developmentally appropriate technologies identified for every phase of the sequence), modeling relevant phenomena about biodiversity and ecosystems through snails, scaffolding for teachers implementing the sequence, and activities that enhance STEM education. A teaching-learning sequence that addresses snails as study objects for 4th grade is presented and validated, allowing us to continue the next phase of our research with schools.

In this paper, virtual reality was used as an educational technology that allowed users to virtually rotate 3-D objects and helped to enhance their spatial ability, which would be particularly useful in future careers in STEM. A 2 (display) x 2 (controller) x 2 (gender) experimental design was conducted. Researchers used a 2-D monoscopic display and a stereoscopic display to manipulate two different conditions of immersion, while a computer mouse and a hand-held controller were applied to measure the effects from two different levels of interactivity. Gender was examined due to prior research suggesting that males were better at MR tasks than females. The dependent variables were various perceptions and behavioral intentions developed from relevant theories in technology acceptance. The results showed that users' positive perceptions and intention to use the novel MR system were amplified whenever better immersive and interactive experiences were provided simultaneously, or when the inferior immersive and interactive experiences were offered at the same time. Females under a better immersive environment perceived better feelings of enjoyment, confirmation, satisfaction, and behavioral intention, compared with their male counterparts.

For the evaluation, a two-phase user study with 30 participants was conducted to measure the system's effectiveness and improvements in long-term training, as well as to examine user experience against traditional methods of training-2D videos and textual manuals.

A feasibility study was conducted where we compared aspects of the two systems so as to allow the suggestion of the proper technology to utilize according to a user's aims. The results showed higher levels of presence and more positive experience by the participants who used the VR system compared to those who used the desktop version. On the other hand, greater learning gains were demonstrated in participants who used the desktop version compared to those who used the VR version. No differences were shown between the two groups regarding the participants' change of attitudes toward the archaeology of Cyprus.</p>",Journal

In a higher-education context, these immersive technologies make it possible to teach complex molecular topics in a way that may aid or even supersede traditional approaches such as molecular models, textbook images, and traditional screen-based computational environments. In this work we describe a study involving 22 third-year UK undergraduate chemistry students who undertook a traditional computational chemistry class complemented by an additional component which we designed to utilize real-time interactive molecular dynamics simulations in VR (iMD-VR). Exploiting the flexibility of an open-source iMD-VR framework which we recently described, the students were given three short tasks to complete in iMD-VR: (1) interactive rearrangement of the chorismate molecule to prephenate using forces obtained from density functional theory calculations; (2) unbinding of chorismate from the active site chorismate mutase enzyme using molecular mechanics forces calculated in real-time; and (3) docking of chorismate with chorismate mutase using real-time molecular mechanics forces. A student survey indicated that most students found the iMD-VR component more engaging than the traditional approach, and also that it improved their perceived educational outcomes and their interest in continuing on in the field of computational sciences.",Journal
